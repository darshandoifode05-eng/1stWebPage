    <p class="para2 overlap">Elon Reeve Musk FRS (born June 28, 1971) is a South African-Canadian-American businessman
        and
        entrepreneur. He moved to Canada and later became a U.S. citizen. He was the Commissioner of the Department
        of Government Efficiency for a few months in 2025 during the second Donald Trump administration.[1] He
        became rich through several technology projects, including an online finance company which merged with
        PayPal in the year 2000.[2] Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2021, according to both
        the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list; with an estimated net worth of
        US$500 billion, as recently as October 2025.[3][4] In 2021, he was Time Person of the Year.[5]

        Elon is the current CEO & Chief Product Architect of Tesla, Inc., a company that makes electric vehicles. He
        is also the CEO & CTO of SpaceX, an aerospace company. In 2022, he became the owner of the social media site
        Twitter which he later gave a new name known as X after buying it for USD $44 billion.[6]

        In November 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said that Musk would become a leader of the Department
        of Government Efficiency (DOGE)[7] alongside Vivek Ramaswamy but Ramaswamy stepped down before the
        Department was created.[8]

        Early life and career
        Elon Musk was born to a Canadian mother and a South African father in Pretoria, South Africa, on June 28,
        1971.[9] His parents divorced in 1981 and he mainly lived with his father in different places in South
        Africa.[10] He went to Waterkloof House Preparatory School and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. He
        then moved to Canada in 1988 when he was 17 after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his mother,
        nutritionist and model Maye Musk. He got it before his South African military service was to begin. He felt
        that it would be easier to emigrate to the United States from Canada than from South Africa. Musk and his
        brother started Zip2, a software company, in 1995. In 1999 he sold it and became a millionaire. He then
        started X.com, which merged with the company Confinity to make PayPal. X.com was then renamed to PayPal, and
        he focused on the growing part of the company.[11][12] He then started SpaceX and became the CEO of Tesla.

        Education
        He spent two years at the Queen's School of Business in Kingston, Ontario. He moved to the University of
        Pennsylvania where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. He stayed a year to
        finish his second bachelor's degree in physics. Then he moved to California to attempt to get a PhD in
        applied physics at Stanford but he left the program after only two days because he wanted to pursue his
        entrepreneurial aspirations. These were to start businesses in the internet, renewable energy and outer
        space.[13] He became an American citizen in 2002.[14]

        Projects
        At the end of 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company which focuses on tunneling and infrastructure. He
        mentioned Los Angeles traffic as the reason for starting this company.[15] In March 2017 Elon Musk announced
        he had started another company that aimed to merge human brains with computers called Neuralink.[16]

        In April 2018 he was worth over $10 billion, making him the 37th most wealthy American.[17] Musk is also
        known for helping design and create the Falcon Heavy rocket, which successfully launched on February 6,
        2019.[18]

        In 2022, Musk bought Twitter after complaining about Internet censorship and criticizing Twitter for
        suspending the Babylon Bee. During his first few weeks as CEO, he attracted criticism from some people. Many
        of them criticize him for laying off many employees at once, as well as appearing to have no interest in
        moderating hate speech.[19]

        Politics
        In November 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced that Musk would become a leader of the
        Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a governmental advisory body, with Vivek Ramaswamy.[20] Though
        Ramaswamy later declined, planning to run for governor of Ohio.[8]

        On 20 January 2025, Trump, who just became President of the United States, made Musk the sole Administrator
        of DOGE.[1] That same day during an inauguration day rally, he performed a Nazi salute.[21] However, Musk
        later stated it was a Roman salute, which was also used by fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.[22]

        On May 28, 2025, Musk announced that he would leave the Trump Administration as planned when the special
        government employee's 130 day deadline expired.[23] He officially left DOGE during a joint Oval Office press
        conference with President Trump on May 30, 2025.[24] He has criticized the Trump administration's Big
        Beautiful Bill after leaving office, calling it a "disgusting abomination."[25]

        Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə or /ˈtɛslə/ ⓘ TESS-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean
        energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures, and sells battery electric
        vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar
        shingles, and related products and services.

        Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a
        tribute to the inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla's first
        funding round and became the company's chairman, subsequently claiming to be a co-founder; in 2008, he was
        named chief executive officer. The company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car,
        in 2008; the Model S sedan in 2012; the Model X SUV in 2015; the Model 3 sedan in 2017; the Model Y
        crossover in 2020; the Tesla Semi truck in 2022; and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.

        Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July
        2020, it has been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a US$1
        trillion company, the sixth US company to reach that valuation. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the
        Forbes Global 2000.[5] In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share.

        Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024[6] and February 2025,[7] and
        since May 2025.[8] In November 2025, Tesla approved a pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk, which he is to
        receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.[9] In January 2026, the company would lose its status as
        world's lead manufacturer of electric vehicles.[10]

        Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming
        from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual
        harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public
        relations department, and controversial statements from Musk, including overpromising on the company's
        driving assist technology and product release timelines.

        History
        Main article: History of Tesla, Inc.
        Founding (2003–2004)
        The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc., on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc
        Tarpenning.[11][12] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[13]
        Eberhard said that he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core
        technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor".[14]

        Ian Wright joined Eberhard and Tarpenning a few months later.[11] In February 2004, the company raised
        US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12.5 million in 2024) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent
        to $10.8 million in 2024) from Elon Musk, who had received $176 million from the sale of his interest in
        PayPal two years earlier.[15] Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder
        of Tesla.[16][17][13] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]

        A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard,
        Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[19]

        Roadster (2005–2009)
        Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation)
        Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business
        operations.[20] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and
        then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[21]

        In February 2005, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor
        Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw
        investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former
        eBay president Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private
        financing investment to over $105 million.[23]

        In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Musk, to step down as CEO.[24] Eberhard then took
        the title of "President of Technology" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder
        Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the
        company in January 2008.[25] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December
        2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and president.[26] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[26] In June
        2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[27] The case was dismissed in
        August 2009.[28]

        Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in
        Menlo Park.[29][30] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had
        contributed $70 million of his money to the company.[31]

        In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States
        Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan
        Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of
        commercial powertrain technology.[32] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.</p>
